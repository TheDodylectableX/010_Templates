# Dody's Research Notes
This repository stores all of my binary templates for [SweetScape Software's 010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) program, Stuff related to game file formats such as *(but not limited to)* models, textures and archives to name a few data types. **All templates here are tested on PC versions of said games unless stated otherwise per BT.**

# Binary Templates - How to Use:
1. **Read DETAILS.MD for reference on every binary template in this repository to understand how they work.**
2. Download the repository's code as .ZIP, Extract the archive wherever you want but **don't change the folder structure to maintain compatibility with Common.bt as a dependency!**
3. To use the desired template make sure you have the right file that matches it's structure, Drag and drop the desired binary template into 010 Editor's window and press the play icon or F5 to execute it then select the file you want to run the template on, If done correctly you should be able to see template's results on screen and in the output section that it worked.
